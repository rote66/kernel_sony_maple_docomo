How to build kernel:

  Prerequisites:

    * The ARM cross-compiler
      You can use prebuild executable binary which is included in
      standard Android repository. Please visit to external site.
      In case of this platform, we recommend to use gcc 4.9 or later
      such as aarch64-linux-android-4.9 to avoid known issues.
      
    * In emp-remastered please use clang compiler


  Step 1: Build Your Kernel
    $ cd <your-kernel-dir>

    $ export ARCH=arm64

    $ make maple_dcm_defconfig O=./out

    $ PATH="<path to clang folder>/bin:<path to 64-bit gcc folder>/bin:${PATH}" \
      make -j$(nproc --all) O=out \
                      ARCH=arm64 \
                      CC=clang \
                      CLANG_TRIPLE=aarch64-linux-gnu- \
                      CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-android-

    You can see arch/arm64/boot/Image-dtb if you succeed in building.


  Step 2: Repack to flashable zip
    (In the Linux Kernel directory)
    (In test,flash location is FOTAKernel.Please manual modify updater-script
    $ ./repack
