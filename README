How to build kernel:

  Prerequisites:

    * The ARM cross-compiler
      You can use prebuild executable binary which is included in
      standard Android repository. Please visit to external site.
      In case of this platform, we recommend to use gcc 4.9 or later
      such as aarch64-linux-android-4.9 to avoid known issues.
      
    * In emp/emp-hmp branch must use gcc 5 or later


  Step 1: Build Your Kernel
    $ cd <your-kernel-dir>

    $ export ARCH=arm64

    $ export PATH=<path-to-cross-compiler-executables>:$PATH
      NOTE: Please set the location of the ARM cross-compiler.

    $ export CROSS_COMPILE=<toolchain-prefix>
      NOTE: Please set the prefix of the ARM cross-compiler.
            ex) aarch64-linux-android-

    $ make maple_docomo_defconfig O=./out

    $ make O=./out

    You can see arch/arm64/boot/Image-dtb if you succeed in building.


  Step 2: Repack to flashable zip
    (In the Linux Kernel directory)
    (In test,flash location is FOTAKernel.Please git revert d72af961457cc94c2037a86e9e6221a42d7a60c5
    $ ./repack
